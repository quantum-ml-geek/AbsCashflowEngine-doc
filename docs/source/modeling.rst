Modeling
***********

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated

Deal modeling is a process to build deal class with descriptive components follows:

* Dates info

  * Cutoff day / Closing Date / (Next/First) payment Date or series of custom dates
* Asset info 
  
  pool asset attributes, loan by loan or repline level data or projected cashflow as input
* Bond info
  
  bonds with different types and equity tranche
* Waterfall info 
  Describe the priority of payments when:

  * On Closing Date (Optional, One-off)
  * End of pool collection (Optional, reoccurring)
  * Distribution day for all the bonds and fees (reoccurring)
  * Clean up call (Optional, One-off)
* Triggers (Optional) 
  
  describe what may happened then what state changed should be performed in deal
* Liquidity Provider (Optional) 
  
  entities provides interest bearing/non-bearing support to shortfall of fee/interest or bond principal
* Hedges (Optional) 
  
  * interest rate swap
  * interest rate cap


Structure of a `Generic` deal 
==================================

There are couple must-have components in a deal:

.. graphviz::
    :name: sphinx.ext.graphviz
    :caption: deal components
    :alt: deal components
    :align: center
    
    digraph {
        rankdir = LR
        Deal -> DealDates [label="Must"]
        DealDates -> payFreq [label="Frequency distribution"]
        DealDates -> poolFreq [label="Frequency collect pool cash"]
        payFreq -> Waterfall [label="When to run"]
        poolFreq -> Waterfall [label="When to run"]
        Deal -> Pool [label="Must"]
        Deal -> "Collection Rule" [label="Must"]
        Pool -> "Collection Rule" [label="Generate Cash"]
        "Collection Rule" -> Accounts [label="Deposit proceeds"]
        Deal -> Accounts [label="Must"]
        Deal -> Waterfall [label="Must"]
        Accounts -> Waterfall [label="Source of funds"]
        Waterfall -> Bonds [label="Pay"]
        Waterfall -> Fees [label="Pay"]
        Deal -> Bonds [label="Must"]
        Deal -> Fees [label="Optional"]
        Deal -> Trigger [label="Optional"]
        Deal -> "Liquiditiy Provider" [label="Optional"]
        Deal -> Ledger [label="Optional"]
        Deal -> InterestRateSwap [label="Optional"]
        Deal -> InterestCap [label="Optional"]
    }

To model them via sequential parameter ( *Not Recommend* ):

.. code-block:: python

    from absbox import Generic
    
    generalDeal = Generic(
        "Deal Name/Description"
        ,<Dates>
        ,<Asset/Pool Info>
        ,<Account info>
        ,<Bonds Info>
        ,<Fee Info>
        ,<Waterfall Info>
        ,<Collection Rule>
        ,<Call settings>
        ,<Liquidation facilities>
        ,<Custom data/formula>
        ,<Triggers>
        ,<Deal Status>
    )

Building Blocks 
==================

`Generic` is a class that represent `SPV` which contains the dates/liabilities/assets/waterfall/trigger/hedge information.

.. code-block:: python
    
    from absbox import Generic


There are 5 reusable building blocks: ``<DatePattern>``, ``<Formula>``, ``<Condition>``, ``<Curve>``, ``<Pricing Method>``, all of them are being used in different components.

.. note::
   It looks boring at first place to learn the ``Building Blocks`` but these are well designed and are essential to tackle the complexity of structured finance.
   

DatePattern
-------------

``<DatePattern>`` is used to describe a series of dates .

* ``"MonthFirst"``  -> Every Jun 1, May 1 during the projection
* ``"MonthEnd"``  ->Every  Month End ,like Jan 31, Feb 28/29  during the projection
* ``"QuarterFirst"`` -> Every March 1 , Jun 1 , Sep 1 , Dec 1 during the projection
* ``"QuarterEnd"``  -> Every March 31, Jun 30, Sep 30, Dec 31 during the projection
* ``"YearFirst"`` -> Every Jan 1 during the projection
* ``"YearEnd"`` -> Every Dec 31 during the projection
* ``["MonthDayOfYear",M,D]`` -> Every a day of the year , like Feb 14 on every year during the projection
* ``["DayOfMonth",M]`` -> A day of the month , like 15 on each month during the projectionh
* ``["CustomDate","YYYY-MM-DD1","YYYY-MM-DD2"]`` -> a series of user defined dates
* ``["EveryNMonth","YYYY-MM-DD",N]`` -> a seriers day starts with "YYYY-MM-DD", then every other N months afterwards

Composite ``<DatePattern>``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

DatePatterns can be composed together:

* ``["After","YYYY-MM-DD",<datepattern>]`` -> a ``<datapattern>`` after "YYYY-MM-DD"(exclusive)
* ``["AllDatePattern",<datepattern1>,<datepattern2>.....]`` -> a union set of date pattern during the projection, like sum of dates
* ``["ExcludeDatePattern",<datepattern1>,<datepattern2>.....]`` -> build dates from 1st ``<datepattern1>`` and exclude dates from ``<datepattern2>,<datepattern3>``... 
* ``["OffsetDateDattern",<datepattern>,N]`` ->  build dates from ``<datepattern>`` and offset days by N ( positive N move dates to future) , negative N will move dates to past ) 

Formula 
---------

Structured product is using ``formula`` to define the amount of account transfer, principal paydown or fee pay limit etc.

``absbox`` use the concept of ``formula`` in an extreamly composable way, a ``formula`` can be a variable reference to deal attributes.

Condition
------------

condition is a `boolean` type test

* it can be set up in reserve account to define different target reserve amount;
* or in the waterfall to run the distribution action only when the testing is passing;
* or it can be used in trigger to describle whether it will be triggered or not.

There are couple type of ``Condition`` to perform :

Compare with a number 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``[<formula>,">",val]`` -> true when <formula> greater than a value
* ``[<formula>,"<",val]`` -> true when <formula> less than a value
* ``[<formula>,">=",val]`` -> true when <formula> greater or equals to a value
* ``[<formula>,"<=",val]`` -> true when <formula> less or equals than a value
* ``[<formula>,"=",val]`` -> true when <formula> equals to a value

Compare with a bool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``[<formula>,True]`` -> true when <formula> is equal to `True`
* ``[<formula>,False]`` -> true when <formula> is equal to `False`

Compare with a curve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``[<formula>,">",curve]`` -> true when <formula> greater than a curve
* ``[<formula>,"<",curve]`` -> true when <formula> less than a curve
* ``[<formula>,">=",curve]`` -> true when <formula> greater or equals to a curve

* ``["<",date]`` -> before certain date
* ``[">",date]`` -> after certain date
* ``["<=",date]`` -> On or beore certain date
* ``[">=",date]`` -> On or after certain Date

Deal Status 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

available status :ref:`Deal Status`

* ``["status", "Amortizing"]`` -> true if current status is `Amortizing`
* ``["status", "Revolving"]`` -> true if current status is `Revolving`
* ``["status", "Accelerated"]`` -> true if current status is `Accelerated`

* ``["status", "Ended"]`` -> true if current status is `Ended`



Nested Condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``["all",<condition>,<condition>....]`` -> true if all of <condition> is true
* ``["any",<condition>,<condition>....]`` -> true if any of <condition> is true

Curve & Table 
----------------

Curve
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``Curve`` was an abstract type of a series time-depend data points, which are being used in couple components:

* Bond Schedule Amortization balance
* Interest Rate assumpition 
* An curve for tartget reserve balance for account
* Threshold curve for trigger , like cumulative default rate
* A curve in custom data component.

To build a ``Curve`` , just a list of 2-element list 

.. code-block:: python

  [["2022-01-01",150],["2022-02-01",200]]

Table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``Table`` is just a table with two columns *ONLY* , it serves a purpose of mapping from value of type A to value of type B.

.. code-block:: python

  [[10,150],[20,200]]

  [["A",150],["B",200]]

  [[100,"A"],[200,"B"]]


Pricing Method
----------------
``<Pricing Method>`` was an annotation used to price an ``Asset`` when waterfall action trying to liquidate assets or buy revolving assets.

there are couple ways of pricing

Pricing by Balance 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * ``["Current|Defaulted", a, b]``  -> Applies ``a`` as factor to current balance of a performing asset; ``b`` as factor to current balance of a defaulted asset
  * ``["Current|Delinquent|Defaulted", a, b, c]`` -> same as above ,but with a ``b`` applies to an asset in deliquency.
  * ``["PV|Defaulted", a, b]`` ->  using ``a`` as pricing curve to discount future cashflow of performing asset while use ``b`` as factor to current balance of defautled asset.

Pricing by Cashflow 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * ``["PVCurve", ts]`` -> using `ts` as pricing curve to discount future cashflow of all assets.

Pricing by a rate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * ``[PvRate, r]``  -> price with a fixed annualized rate
  * ``[PvRate, <rate formula> ]`` -> using a rate formula, :ref:`Ratio Type`

Components
============

Deal Dates
------------

Depends on the status of deal, the dates shall be modeled either in ``ongoing`` or ``preclosing``

.. graphviz::
    :name: sphinx.ext.graphviz
    :caption: how to model deal date
    :alt: how to model deal date
    :align: center

    digraph {
        b -> OngoingDates [label="Yes"]
        b -> PreCloseDates [label="Not yet"]
        PreCloseDates
        OngoingDates
        b [shape=diamond, label="Deal Closed ?"]
    }


PreClosing Deal dates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::
    if deal was modeled as `PreClosing` ,user has to include a ``new status`` in deal status (``PreClosing``, ``<new status>``)

if it is ``preclosing`` stage ( the deal has not been issued yet )

``cutoff``
    All pool cashflow after `Cutoff Date` belongs to the SPV
``closing``
    fee/bonds starts from `Closing Date` 
``firstPay``
    First execution of payment waterfall
``stated``
    legal maturity date of the deal.
``poolFreq``
    a :ref:`DatePattern`, describle the dates that collect cashflow from pool
``payFreq``
    a :ref:`DatePattern`, describle the dates that distribution funds to fees and bonds.

date example
  .. code-block:: python

      {"cutoff":"2022-11-01"
      ,"closing":"2022-11-15"
      ,"firstPay":"2022-12-26"
      ,"stated":"2030-01-01"
      ,"poolFreq":"MonthEnd"
      ,"payFreq":["DayOfMonth",20]}

Ongoing Deal dates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

if deal is ``ongoing`` ( which has been issued ), the difference is that in ``PreClosing`` mode, the projection will include an event of `OnClosingDate` which describe a sequence of actions to be performed at the date of `closing`

``collect``
    :code:`[<last pool collection date>,<next pool collection date>]`
``pay``
    :code:`[<last distribution payment date>,<next distribution payment date>]`
``poolFeq``
    a :ref:`DatePattern`, describle the dates that collect cashflow from pool
``payFeq``
    a :ref:`DatePattern`, describle the dates that distribution funds to fees and bonds.

.. code-block:: python

    {"collect":["2022-11-01"   # last pool collection date,
                ,"2022-12-01"] # next pool collection date
    ,"pay":["2022-11-15"   # last distribution payment date,
            ,"2022-12-15"] # next distribution date 
    ,"stated":"2030-01-01"
    ,"poolFreq":"MonthEnd"
    ,"payFreq":["DayOfMonth",20]
    }

``payFreq`` and ``poolFreq``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Usually pool collection date is prior to waterfall payment date in a single cycle.

* Pool cash proceeds were deposit to accounts at ``poolFreq`` date.
* Engine will pick a waterfall base on ``deal status`` to exectue waterfall on ``payFreq`` date 

``payFreq`` and ``poolFreq`` can be same day,and  engine will run pool collection before waterfall execution by default.

Custom Defined Dates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
User are free to feed in a series of custom defined pool collection date / bond payment dates to accomodate holidays etc.

.. code-block:: python

   {"poolCollection":["2023-01-31","2023-02-28"...]
   ,"distirbution":["2023-02-01","2023-03-01"...]
   ,"cutoff":"2022-11-21"
   ,"closing":"2023-01-01"}


Deal Status 
----------------

Deal status is a ``Tag`` to describe the current ``status`` of deal, it can be one of the following:

.. graphviz::
    :name: sphinx.ext.graphviz
    :caption: deal cycle
    :alt: deal cycle
    :align: center

    digraph {
      rankdir=LR;
      PreClosing -> Revolving [label="if revolving"]
      PreClosing -> Amortizing
      Revolving -> Amortizing
      Amortizing -> End
    }

The ``status`` is being used by engine to:

* pick up the ``right`` waterfall actions of the deal on dates of `payFreq`.
* can be used in ``waterfall`` or ``Condition`` to conditionally execute actions or calculate a value

Deal Status Enums
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``(PreClosing,"<new status>")``
  Deal is in pre-closing stage, which means the deal has not been issued yet. Make sure to include a ``new status`` which deal will enter after ``Closing Date``
``RampUp``
  Deal is ramping up to build assets
``Revolving``
  Deal is not amortizing yet, which means the deal is still in revolving stage.
``Amortizing``
  Deal is amortizing, the deal is picking ``Amortizing`` waterfall on distribution dates .
``Accelerated``
  Deal is in accelerated stage, which means the deal is picking ``Accelerated`` waterfall on distribution dates .
``Defaulted``
  Deal is in default stage, which means the deal is picking ``Defaulted`` waterfall on distribution dates .
``Ended`` 
  Means deal stop projection cashflow.

Changing Deal Status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``Deal Status`` can be changed via:

* ``Trigger`` -> :ref:`Effects/Consequence of a trigger`
* auto enter new status if it is a ``PreClosing`` status

.. seealso::

  To view the result of status changes in deal run :ref:`Deal Status Change During Run`


Fee/Expenses
--------------

syntax
  ``({fee name} , {fee description} )``, fees fall into types below :

  Optional fields in ``{fee description}``:

  * ``"feeStart"`` ->  the date fee start to become effective
  * ``"feeDueDate"`` -> the date when due amount was calculated 
  * ``"feeDue"`` ->    total oustanding due amount 
  * ``"feeLastPaidDate"`` -> the date when last paid

.. warning::

  Auto Accrue Type Fee will calculate due amount of fee automatically. 
  
  User shouldn't accrue them mannually in waterfall again.

.. list-table:: Auto Accrue Type Fee
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Fee Type
     - Auto Accrural ? 
   * - ``RecurFee``
     - Yes

     - Yes
   * - ``NumFee``
     - Yes
   * - ``Fee by table``
     - Yes
   * - Others 
     - No




one-off fee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

with a oustanding balance and will be paid off once it paid down to zero

syntax
  ``{"fixFee": <balance>}`` : total oustanding fee amount to be paid

.. code-block:: python
  
  ("issuance_fee"
      ,{"type":{"fixFee":100}})

recurrance fee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

a fix amount fee which occurs by defined :ref:`DatePattern`

syntax
  ``{"recurFee":[ <DatePattern>,<new due amount on each DatePattern> ]}``

.. code-block:: python
    
   ,("rating_fee"
    ,{"type":{"recurFee":[["MonthDayOfYear",6,30],15]}})


percentage fee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
pecentage fee, a fee type which the due amount depends on a percentage of :ref:`Formula`

like a fee is base on 

  * percentage of `pool balance`
  * a percentage of pool collection `interest`
  * a higher/lower amount of two `formula`
  * a sum of `formula` 
  * ...

syntax 
  ``{"pctFee":[ <Formula>,<percentage> ]}``

.. code-block:: python
  
  ("bond_service_fee"
      ,{"type":{"pctFee":[("bondBalance",),0.02]}})
  
  ("bond_service_fee"
      ,{"type":{"pctFee":[("cumPoolDefaultedBalance",),0.03]}})


annualized fee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

similar to `percentage fee` but it will use an annualized rate to multiply the value of :ref:`Formula`.
either reference to pool balance  or bond balance , etc.... it will accure type fee, which if not being paid, it will increase the due amount.

syntax 
  ``{"annualPctFee":[ <Formula>,<percentage> ] }``

.. code-block:: python
  
  ("servicer_fee"
      ,{"type":{"annualPctFee":[("poolBalance",),0.02]}})


custom fee flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A user defined time series expenses, the date and amount can be customized.

like 100 USD at 2022-1-20 and incur other 20 USD at 2024-3-2

syntax 
  ``{"customFee":[ [<Date>,<Amount>] .... ]}``

.. code-block:: python
  
   ,("irregulargfee"
    ,{"type":{"customFee":[["2024-01-01",100]
                          ,["2024-03-15",50]]}})


count type fee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The fee due equals to a number multiply a unit fee. The number is a formula reference.

syntax 
  ``{"numFee":[ <DatePattern>, <Formula>, <Amount> ]}``

.. code-block:: python
  
   ,("borrowerFee"
    ,{"type":{"numFee":[["DayOfMonth",20],("borrowerNumber",),1]}}

target amount fee 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The fee due amount is equal to ``max ( <Formula 1> - <Formula 2>,0)``

syntax
  ``{"targetBalanceFee:[<Formula 1> <Formula 2>]}``

.. code-block:: python 

   ("VAT"
     ,{"type":{"targetBalanceFee":[("poolBalance",),("bondBalance",)]))


fee by collection periods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. versionadded:: 0.23.5

The fee due amount depends on the number of collection peirods collected.

syntax
  ``{"byPeriod":<Amount Per Period>}``

.. code-block:: python

   #period , serviceFee charge 15 in each period
   ("serviceFee", {"type":{"byPeriod":15}})

fee by table
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. versionadded:: 0.23.5

The fee due amount depends on a :ref:`Formula` based value and look up in table.

syntax
  ``{"byTable": [ <DatePattern>, <Formula>, <Table>]}``

.. code-block:: python

   #look up table with value of pool balance * 0.01
   ("serviceFee", {"type":{"byTable":["MonthEnd"
                                      ,("*",("poolBalance",),0.01)
                                      ,[(0,5),(2,10),(10,15)]]
                                   }})


Pool
---------

``Pool`` represents a set of assets ,which generate cashflows to support expenses and liabilities.

* it can either has a loan level ``asset`` or ``projected cashflow``
* other fields like ``issuance balance``, which will be supplimental to calculate certain value , like ``Pool Factor``

syntax
  ``Pool`` is modeled as map with following fields:

  * ``assets`` -> a list of assets
  * ``cashflow`` -> a list of projected cashflow
  * ``issuanceStat`` -> a map describe extra information of pool
  * ``extendBy`` -> :ref:`DatePattern`, used to provide extra dates of pool collection

.. warning::

  ``assets`` and ``cashflow`` are mutually exclusive, only one of them can be used in a pool

issuanceStat
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
a map represents history information of a `ongoing` deal.

``IssuanceBalance``
  Issuance balance of deal, which used to be queried via `poolFactor`, `cumPoolDefaultedRate` etc 

``AccruedInterest``
  .. versionadded:: 0.23

  This field will `claw back` interest in pool cashflow.

  .. code-block:: python

    {'assets':[["Mortgage"
              ,{"originBalance":2200,"originRate":["fix",0.045],"originTerm":30
                ,"freq":"Monthly","type":"Level","originDate":"2021-02-01"}
                ,{"currentBalance":2200
                ,"currentRate":0.08
                ,"remainTerm":20
                ,"status":"current"}]]
      ,'issuanceStat':{"AccruedInterest":23.35}
     }


``HistoryDefaults``
  Cumulative Defaulted balance as of ``last collection`` date 
``HistoryDelinquency``
  Cumulative Delinquency balance as of ``last collection`` date 
``HistoryLoss``
  Cumulative Loss balance as of ``last collection`` date 
``HistoryRecoveries``
  Cumulative Recovery received as of ``last collection`` date 
``HistoryPrincipal``
  Cumulative Principal paid as of ``last collection`` date 
``HistoryPrepayment``
  Cumulative Prepayment paid as of ``last collection`` date 

Multiple Pools 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 0.24.0

A deal may be setup with a multiple pools with a name.

.. code-block:: python

  "pool":{"PoolA":{'assets':[["Mortgage"
                    ,{"originBalance":2200,"originRate":["fix",0.045],"originTerm":30
                      ,"freq":"Monthly","type":"Level","originDate":"2021-02-01"}
                      ,{"currentBalance":2200
                      ,"currentRate":0.08
                      ,"remainTerm":30
                      ,"status":"current"}]]},
          "PoolB":{'assets':[["Mortgage"
                    ,{"originBalance":1100,"originRate":["fix",0.045],"originTerm":30
                      ,"freq":"Monthly","type":"Level","originDate":"2021-02-01"}
                      ,{"currentBalance":1100

                      ,"remainTerm":30
                      ,"status":"current"}]]}
  }

or, it's possbile to include different asset type in same deal:

.. code-block:: python 

  "pool":{"PoolA":{'assets':[["Mortgage"
                    ,{"originBalance":2200,"originRate":["fix",0.045],"originTerm":30

                      ,{"currentBalance":2200
                      ,"currentRate":0.08
                      ,"remainTerm":30
                      ,"status":"current"}]]},
          "PoolB":{'assets':[["Loan"
                          ,{"originBalance": 80000

                            ,"status": "Current"}]]}
        }

Pls make sure there are couple adjustment to set assumptions and get result.

Fixed Asset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 0.22.3

``Fixed Asset`` is a generalized concept to model couple different types of fixed asset which generates cashflow :

* ``capacity`` : max number of `unit` generated by the asset in a given period
  * ``capacity`` multiply `utility` rate from assumption ,then will yield *ACTUAL* number of marketable `unit` 
* ``unite price`` : input from assumption, which used to set market price of `unit` to be sold

This type of asset can be used to model `future flow of securitization` : `Hotel room` / `Solar Panel` / `EV Charger Station` or anything which has a cap on capacity and it would generate something to sell.

``capacity``
  can be a fixed value or a curve which depends on ``remainTerm``, which suggests the production would decrease with time, for example, the `Solar Panel` . or a fixed value, like a `Hotel Room`

``amortize``
  either ``Straight`` or ``DecliningBalance`` .

.. code-block:: python

  assets = [["FixedAsset" ,{"start":"2023-11-01","originBalance":100_0000,"originTerm":120
                            ,"residual":10_0000,"period":"Monthly","amortize":"Straight"

.. warning::

  To project cashflow , user MUST set assumption for this type asset.

Proceeds
^^^^^^^^^^

``Proceeds`` refer to cash yields from pool:

.. list-table:: Proceeds By Types
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Asset Type
     - Principal
     - Interest
     - Prepayment

Pool Source Enums
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``CollectedInterest``
* ``CollectedPrincipal``
* ``CollectedRecoveries``
* ``CollectedPrepayment``
* ``CollectedRental``
* ``CollectedCash``

.. warning::

  ``CollectedCash``  includes other fields, make sure use it exclusively with other pool source.

Allocation Rule
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The rule was defined as a *List*, each element is a *List* with 2 elements.

* 1st element describes the ``Proceeds`` 
* 2nd element describes `percentage` to be allocated to each account

  * if it is just an `account name`,then 100% of ``Proceeds`` will be flowed into that account

syntax
  * ``[<Proceeds from pool>, <Account to be depsit>]``
  * ``[<Proceeds from pool>, [<Allocation ration1>,<Account01>],[<Allocation ration2>,<Account02>]... ]``


exmaple:

.. code-block:: python 

  [["CollectedInterest",[[0.8,"acc01"],[0.2,"acc02"]]] 
    # 80% of interest will be allocated to acc01
    # 20% of interest will be allocated to acc02
    ,["CollectedPrincipal",[[0.8,"acc01"],[0.2,"acc02"]]]
    ,["CollectedPrepayment","acc01"] 
    # 100% of prepayment will be allocated to acc01
    ,["CollectedRecoveries","acc01"]]



Accounts
---------

Accounts serves as intermediary to control flow of cash between assets and liabilities of SPV.

There are two types of `Account`:

  * ``Bank Account`` -> which used to collect money from pool and pay out to fees/bonds
  * ``Reserve Account`` -> with one addtional attribute to ``Bank Account`` , specifies target reserve amount of the account

syntax:
  ``(<AccountName:String>,<AccountFields:Dict>)``

.. list-table:: Account By Types
   :widths: 15 10 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Account Type
     - Reserve Target
     - Interest Bearing
   * - Bank Account
     - No
     - Optional
   * - Reserve Account
     - Yes
     - Optional

syntax
  ``({account name},{account description})``


Bank Account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is only one field to be setup : ``balance`` 

syntax
  ``(<account name>,{'balance':<cash on account>})``

.. code-block:: python

  (("principalAccount",{"balance":0})
   ,("repaymentAccount",{"balance":0}))

Reserve Account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is one extra field to set for ``Reserve Account`` : ``type``

syntax
  ``(<account name>,{'balance':<cash on account>,'type':<reserve target amount>})``

  * Fix Amount: a single reserve amount 
  
    .. code-block:: python

      ("ReserveAccountA",{"balance":0
                         ,"type":{"fixReserve":1000}})

  * Formula: the target reserve amount is derived from a :ref:`Formula` , like 2% of pool balance
  
    .. code-block:: python

      ("ReserveAccountB",{"balance":0
                         ,"type":{"targetReserve":[("poolBalance",),0.015]}})

  * Nested Formula, the target reserve amount is base on higher or lower of two formula 

  * Conditional amount starts with ``When``, the target reserve amount depends on :ref:`Condition`:
    
    * Use 1st formula if condition is true
    * Use 2nd formula if condition is false
  
    .. code-block:: python

Model Reinvestment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To model the interest or short-term investment income in the account.

* fix rate syntax: 

  ``{"period": <date Pattern>, "rate": <number>, "lastSettleDate":<date>}``

* floater rate syntax: 

  ``{"period": <date Pattern>, "index": <index name>, "spread": <number>, "lastSettleDate":<date>}``

Bonds/Tranches
---------------

Bonds/Tranches serves as a ``Liability`` in the SPV, with two components to model:

* Interest
* Principal

.. graphviz::

      principal -> "Lock out"
      principal -> "Equity"
      interest -> "Fix Rate"
      interest -> "Floater Rate"
      interest -> "Step up Rate"
    }


syntax
    ``({bond/tranche name},{bond/tranche description})``

optional fields:
  * ``maturityDate`` : maturity date of bond
  * ``lastAccrueDate`` : last date of interest accrued
  * ``dueInt`` : due interest amount already accrued

Interest
^^^^^^^^^^^

there are 3 types of `Interest` settings for bonds. 

.. seealso:: User has the option to accrue with custom rate / custom balance in waterfall action ``calIntBy``


Fix Rate 
""""""""""""

The bond will use an annualized fixed rate during till maturity, with option of day count convention.

syntax
    :code:`"rateType":{"fix":0.0569}`

    :code:`"rateType":{"fix":0.0569,"dayCount":"DC_ACT_365"}`

Float Rate 
""""""""""""""""

The bond will use an initial floater rate , with an index and spread, and a reset frequency, with option of day count convention.

syntax
    :code:`"rateType":{"floater":[<start rate>, <index>, <spread>, <reset dates>]}`
    
    :code:`"rateType":{"floater":[0.05, "SOFR1Y",-0.0169,"MonthEnd"]}`
    
    :code:`"rateType":{"floater":[0.05, "SOFR1Y",-0.0169,"MonthEnd"], "dayCount":"DC_ACT_365"}`
    

Step-Up Rate
""""""""""""""

.. versionadded:: 0.23

The bond will use a step up rate with:

* add a spread to rate on a date.
* add spreads to rate on dates ,described via a :ref:`DatePattern`

syntax
    :code:`{"stepUp":("once","2024-01-01",0.01)}`
    
    :code:`{"stepUp":("ladder","2024-01-01",0.01,"QuarterEnd")}`
    
.. seealso:: 

  :ref:`Step-Up Coupon`

Cap & Floor 
""""""""""""""

.. versionadded:: 0.23.4

Bond Rate may subject to a optional cap or floor ,or both.

syntax
  cap :code:`"rateType":("cap",0.06, {"floater":[0.05, "SOFR1Y",-0.0169,"MonthEnd"]})`

  floor :code:`"rateType":("floor",0.005, {"floater":[0.05, "SOFR1Y",-0.0169,"MonthEnd"]})`

Principal 
^^^^^^^^^^^
there are 4 types of `Principal` for bonds/tranches

  * ``Sequential``： can be paid down as much as its oustanding balance
  * ``PAC``： Balance of bond can only be paid down by a predefined schedule
  * ``Lockout``： Principal won't be paid after lockout date
  * ``Equity``：  No interest and shall serve as junior tranche

Sequential 
"""""""""""""
A bond with will receive principal till it's balance reduce to 0.

                     ]}})


Lockout
"""""""""""""
A bond with ``Lockout`` type is used to setup bond with only recieve principal after the `lockout date`

This bond only get principal repayed starting at `2021-09-20`

           ,"bondType":{"Equity":None} })


Waterfall
-------------

Waterfall means a *list* of ``Action`` to be executed. A Deal may have more than one waterfalls.

It was modeled as a map, with key as identifier to distinguish different type of waterfall.

* ``"amortizing"`` -> will be picked when deal status is `Amortizing`
* ``("amortizing", "accelerated")`` -> will be picked when deal status is `Accelerated`
* ``("amortizing", "defaulted")`` -> will be picked when deal status is `Defaulted`
* ``"endOfCollection"`` -> will be exectued at the end of each collection period
* ``"default"`` -> the default waterfall to be executed if no other waterfall applicable
* ``"cleanUp"`` -> will be exectued *once* when deal is being clean up call
* ``"closingDay"`` -> will be exectued *once* at the `Day of Closing` if deal status is `PreClosing`


How engine pick which waterfall to execute?

.. warning::
   
   Make sure there are waterfall to be run if deal status changed. Otherwise the deal won't do anything. ie. if there is trigger change in deal,make sure there is a corresponding waterfall modeled for that status.


Action
  ``Action`` is a python list, whose elements annoates the parameter of action. In most of cases,

      * ``limit`` -> :ref:`<limit>`
      * ``support`` -> :ref:`<support>`
 
  the ``limit`` is the magic key to make principal payment more versatile. User can control the amount to be paid via a :ref:`Formula` ie.
  
  (from deal: Autoflorence)
      the target amount is ``(end pool balance - (end pool balance * subordination percentage(12%)))``

Conditional Action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two types of `Conditional Action`, which are same in with "IF" / "IF-ELSE" clause in programming language

``If``
  waterfall actions follows will be executed if certain :ref:`Condition` is met.

  .. code-block:: python 
    
    ["If",<conditon>
         ,<Action1>,<Action2>....]


``IfElse``
  first list of actions will be executed if :ref:`Condition` was met , otherwise , second list of actions will be executed

  .. code-block:: python 
    
     ["IfElse",<conditon>
              ,[<Action1>,<Action2>....] # executed if condition is met/True
              ,[<Action1>,<Action2>....] # executed if condition is not met/False
              ]


Inspect Variables during waterfall 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 0.22

this action will query the :ref:`Formula` and tag with <Comment>("optional string") save to result. 
To read the result, please refer to :ref:`View Variables In Waterfall`

syntax
  .. code-block:: python

    ["inspect",<Comment>,<Formula1>,<Formula2>.....]

Booking Ledger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 0.23

This action would book a transaction to the ledger

syntax
  .. code-block:: python

    ["bookBy",<bookType>]

``bookType``

  * ``["PDL",<default>,[(<ledger name>,<cap>)....] ]``
  
    Typically this was used to model `Principal Deficiency Ledger`.

    * ``<default>`` -> definition of `default` of asset balance, ``("cumPoolDefaultedBalance",)``
    * ``[("Bond-B-Ledger",("bondBalance","B"))...]`` -> book the defaults with cap of ``current balance`` of tranche B to `Ledger`: "Bond-B-Ledger"

  * ``["formula",<ledger name>,<Debit|Credit>,<formula>]``

    The most generic booking type ,which just book a ``<formula>`` value to ledger ``<ledger name>``
..
  * ``["AccountDraw",<ledger name>]``
    It was used in ``Support``,when there is insufficent interest or fee payment from account A and account B cures the shortfall ,that amount draw from account B was call "Account Draw" and booked in the ledger.

.. seealso:: 
  
  :ref:`Book Ledger`


Limit & Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

<limit>
""""""""""""

``limit`` is a usedful decorator which describle how much it should pay, usually it's a cap.
it is being widely used in scope :

* pay fee 
* pay interest to bond or limit the principal payment to bond

  *  it is useful to model `target oc` which define how much principal repayment should be.
* transfer between accounts
* limit amount for asset selling
* cap amount for liquidity support

examples: 
  
    * ``{"balPct": 0.6}`` , pay up to 60% of due amount
    * ``{"balCapAmt": 500}`` ,  pay up to 500.
    * ``{"formula": <formula> }``, pay up the :ref:`Formula`


<support>
""""""""""""

``support`` was used to model ,the `extra source fund` to make up the shortfall if there is a shortfall in the payment.

  scope:
    * cure shortfall when pay fee
    * cure shortfall when pay bond interest and principal 

  source of funds:
    * :ref:`Accounts`
    * :ref:`Liquidity Provider`
    * a combination of above

  syntax:
    ``["payFee", {Account}, [<Fee>], {'support':<supports>}]``
    
    * supported by accounts : 
    
      *  ``["account","accountName"]``
    * supported by liquidity provider: 
    
      *  ``["facility","liquidity provider name"]``
    * supported by mix (draw via sequence)
    
      *  ``["support" ,["account","accountName1"] ,["facility","liquidity provider name"] ,["account","accountName2"]]``


Trigger
-----------

``Trigger`` is a generalized concept in `absbox` / `Hastructure`, it is not limited to *pool performance* which is design to protect tranches but a border concept as below:

.. image:: img/trigger.png
  :width: 500
  :alt: version


There are 4 fields in ``Triggers``:

  * ``Condition`` -> it will fire the trigger effects, when :ref:`Condition` is met
  * ``Effects`` -> what would happen if the trigger is fired
  * ``Status`` -> it is triggered or not 
  * ``Curable`` -> whether the trigger is curable

Syntax of trigger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

it is a must to specify :ref:`Trigger Locations`

.. code-block:: python 

  {"BeforeCollect": # optional
    {"triggerName1":
      {"condition":..
      ,"effects":..
      ,"status":..
      ,"curable":..}
      ......
    }
  ,"AfterCollect": # optional
    {}
  ,"BeforeDistribution": # optional 
    {}
  ,"AfterDistribution": # optional
    {}
  }

``Location`` of Trigger:
  * ``BeforeCollect`` 
  * ``AfterCollect``
  * ``BeforeDistribution`` 
  * ``AfterDistribution``
  * during the waterfall

When to run trigger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  
  Trigger can run at 5 point of time.
  
  * Start/End of each Pool Collection Day -> ``BeforeCollect`` / ``AfterCollect``
  * Start/End of each Distribution Day    -> ``BeforeDistribution`` / ``AfterDistribution``
  * During any point of waterfall 


.. image:: img/trigger_in_deal_run.png
  :width: 600
  :alt: trigger_loc

Why there are 5 points of time to run trigger ? 
    Because , when there is a ``Formula`` ,it may reference to bond balance ,but the bond balance varies in different point of time : the balance in ``BeforeDistribution``  is different from ``AfterDistirbution`` as the bond maybe paid down.


Conditons of a trigger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Magically, condition of a trigger is just a :ref:`Condition` from the very begining ! We just reuse that component.


Effects/Consequence of a trigger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Change Deal Status
  Trigger will update the `state` of a deal, like:

    * convert `revolving` to `amortizing`
    * convert `amortizing` to `accelerated`
    * convert `amortizing` to `defaulted`

  .. code-block:: python
    
    "effects":("newStatus","Amortizing") # change deal status to "Amortizing"
    "effects":("newStatus","Accelerated") # change deal status to "Accelerated"
    "effects":("newStatus","Defaulted") # change deal status to "Defautled"

  Once the `state` of deal changed, the deal will pick the corresponding waterfall to run at distribution days.

Accure fees 
  Accure fees if it was triggered

  .. code-block:: python
    
    "effects":["accrueFees","feeName1","feeName2",...]

Change Target Reserve 
  Change reserve target formula of a reserve account

  .. code-block:: python
    
    "effects":["newReserveBalance","accName1",{"fixReserve":1000}]
    "effects":["newReserveBalance","accName1",{"targetReserve":["......"]}]

Add a trigger
  Create a new trigger 

.. code-block:: python
  
  "effects":[("newTrigger"
              ,{"condition":...
               ,"effects":...
               ,"status":...
               ,"curable":...})]

Combination of above
  a list of above can be combined together with keyword ``Effects``

.. code-block:: python
  
  "effects":["Effects"
             ,<effect 1>
             ,<effect 2>
             ,....]

  Example :ref:`Formula based trigger` 


Query trigger during run
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By specify in the `inspect`, user are able to view the status of trigger during the run.

.. seealso::

  To get status of trigger, see query on trigger status :ref:`Bool Type`


Liquidity Provider
---------------------

`Liquidity Provider` is an external entity which can be used as a line of credit/insuer. 

If there is a shortage on fee or interest or principal, user can setup rules to draw cash from the `Liquidity Provider`  and deposity cash to accounts.

There are couple types available:

Unlimit Liquidity 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It provides unlimit liquidity.

.. code-block:: python 

  {"type" : "Unlimited"
  ,"start": <Date>}

Fix Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It provides liquidity up to a fix amount of cash

.. code-block:: python 

  {"lineOfCredit" : 1000
  ,"type": {"total": <Balance> }
  ,"start": <Date>}


Reset Line of Credit 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The line of credit will be reset periodically.

.. code-block:: python 

  {"lineOfCredit" : 1000
  ,"type": {"reset":<DatePattern>
           ,"quota":<CapToReset>}
  ,"start": <Date>}

Formula-based Line of Credit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python 

  {"lineOfCredit" : 1000
  ,"type":{"formula":<Formula>
           ,"pct":<Percentage>}
  ,"start": <Date>}

common properites
  * ``start`` -> when the liquidity provider start to be effective
  * ``lineOfCredit`` -> current available credit to draw
  * ``balance`` -> current balance to be paid back to provider
  * ``rate`` -> interest rate to be used on ``balance``
  * ``fee`` ->  premium feee to be used on ``lineOfCredit``


Interest Rate Hedge 
---------------------

Index Hedge Base
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A base could be:

* a fixed value : ``{"fix":10000}``
* a formula : ``{"formula": <Formula> }``
* a schedule  :  ``{"schedule": <Ts>}`` , :ref:`Curve` type


Interest Rate Swap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Interest Rate Swap` is a 3rd party entity ,which can either deposit money into a SPV or collecting money from SPV. The direction of cashflow depends on the strike rate vs interest rate curve in assumption.

it was modeled as a map ,with key as name to swap ,value serve as properties to swap. The very reason using a map becasue a deal can have multiple Swap contract.

Fields:
  * ``settleDates`` -> :ref:`DatePattern`,describe the settlement dates .
  * ``pair`` -> describe rates to swap (paying rate in left, receiving rate on right)
    
    it can be float to float , fix to float , or float to fix 
  * ``base`` -> :ref:`Index Hedge Base`,describe how reference balance is being updated 
  * ``start`` -> when the swap contract come into effective
  * ``balance`` -> (optional), current reference balance
  * ``lastSettleDate`` -> (optional), last settle date which calculate `netcash`
  * ``netcash`` -> (optional), current cash to pay/to collect 
  * ``stmt`` -> (optional),transaction history

example: 

.. code-block:: python

  swap = {
      "swap1":{"settleDates":"MonthEnd"
               ,"pair":[("LPR5Y",0.01),0.05] # paying a float rate with spread ,and receiving a fix annualized rate
               ,"base":{"formula":("poolBalance",)}
               ,"start":"2021-06-25"
               ,"balance":2093.87}
  }

Interest Rate Cap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 0.23

`Interest Rate Cap` serve as a 3rd party which will accrue cash if interest rate from assumption(:ref:`Interest Rate`) is higher than strike rate.

Fields:
  * ``index`` -> :ref:`Indexes` linked to .
  * ``strike`` -> a :ref:`Curve` data 
  * ``base`` -> :ref:`Index Hedge Base`,the notional balance
  * ``start`` -> start date of cap
  * ``end`` -> end date of cap
  * ``settleDates`` -> :ref:`DatePattern`, settle dates
  * ``rate`` ->  current reference rate
  * ``lastSettleDate`` -> (optional), last settle date which calculate `netcash`
  * ``netcash`` -> (optional), current cash to collect 
  * ``stmt`` -> (optional), transaction history

example: 

.. code-block:: python

  cap = {
      "cap1":{"index":"LIBOR6M"
              ,"strike":["2023-01-01",0.03
                         ,"2024-01-01",0.05]
              ,"base":{"fix":10000}
              ,"start":"2022-01-01"
              ,"end":"2025-01-01"
              ,"settleDates":"QuarterEnd"
              ,"rate":0.035
              ,"lastSettleDate":"2023-06-01"
              ,"netCash":100
              }
  }

Ledgers
------------------------

``Ledger`` conceptually was introduced similar to the same term in accounting. It is just a book which records transaction,for each transaction :

* it is either ``Credit`` or ``Debit``
* it has amount
* it has a oustanding balance 

It can be booked in waterfall action :ref:`Booking Ledger` ,and it can be query oustanding balance /transaction amount :ref:`Ledger` . 

The ``Ledger`` won't hold any cash,but serve a purpose of record. The `balance` or `transaction amount` of ``Ledger`` was used to calculate amount to pay bonds or transfer amount in accounts.

Enough explain for finance people, from engineering pespective, ``Ledger`` is just a ``stateful variable`` during whole projection period 😎


Examples
============

Basic
--------------

.. _exmaple-01:

Subordination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  * Subordination
  * One-off fees
  
.. literalinclude:: deal_sample/test01.py
   :language: python
   :emphasize-lines: 30,33-36

Assumption
-------------

Schedule Cashflow with Default Amount Vector as assumption
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 0.22

* set default amount vector as assumption
* use schedule input cashflow

.. literalinclude:: deal_sample/test13.py
   :language: python
   :emphasize-lines: 66,10-23

Bond 
---------------

Step-Up Coupon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

User can set step-up bond either in one-off basis or increase via a :ref:`DatePattern`

* step-bond is just an optinal field in the bond map 
* user can aggregate all cash in a single aggregation rule

.. literalinclude:: deal_sample/bondStepUp.py
   :language: python
   :emphasize-lines: 26,44

Accumulation/SinkFund redeemption
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

User can model sink-fund like mechanisim to ensure redeem the note timely fashion.

* Time the months before maturity of bond A
* test the number of Months as a :ref:`Condition`
* using *IF* in the waterfall to control deposit cash to a certain account.

Delay of Principal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's common to see that priority during tranches like

::

  Unless the principal balances of the class A-1, class A-2, class A-3 and class A-4 notes have been reduced to zero, the class B and class C notes will not be entitled to any payments of principal until the June 2009 distribution date,
  
  or during any period thereafter in which cumulative realized losses on the trust student loans exceed specified levels. During these periods, in general principal will be paid to the class A-1, class A-2, class A-3 and class A-4 notes, in that order, until each of their principal balances is reduced to zero.
  

We can model these two like:

* a lockout period till "2009-06-30"
* a ``payPrin`` with a ``If`` which reference to ``pool cumulative loss``

.. code-block:: python

    ....
    ,["payPrin","acc01",["A1"]]
    ,["payPrin","acc01",["A2"]]
    ,["If",["or"
          ,["isPaidOff","A1","A2"]
          ,[">=","2009-06-30"]
          ,[("cumPoolNetLossRate",),"<",0.05]]
      ,["payPrin","acc01",["B"]]
      ,["payIntResidual","acc01","B"]]
    ....
                                                                                                                         ]
PayBond Sequential
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* user can set action to pay bond sequentially, with option to set up a limit tie up to :ref:`Formula`

Resecuritizaiton Deal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. versionadded:: 0.25.0

Resecuritizaiton deal is a deal which is backed by a pool of other deals. It's a deal of deal.
A pool is composed of a list of bonds, each of bonds are affliated to other deals.
The relationship is being defined by a tuple :

  ``(<BondName>,<Pct of Bond>,<Date of Acquisition>)``

* In this example , ``test01`` is the undelrying bond which is modeled at line:54
  
  * <BondName> -> which bond cashflow to be flow into the pool 
  * <Pct of Bond> -> pct of cashflow to be flow into the pool
  * <Date of Acquisition> -> since when the bond cashflow to be flow into the pool

* User can set assumption to undelrying deal at line:93-97

  * it's a tuple to describle assumption of underlying deals: ``("ByDealName",<an assumption map>)``
  * ``<an assumption map>``: ``{<underlying deal name>:(<pool assump>, <deal run assump>)}``
  
    * key of map is the name of underlying deal
    * value of map is a tuple ,which is a pair of pool assumption and deal run assumption
  
      *  ``<pool assump>``:  :ref:`Asset Performance Assumption`
      *  ``<deal run assump>``:  :ref:`Deal Assumption`

Liquidity Provider 
---------------------------

Liquidity Provider /Insurance / Ganrantee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Liquidity provider will deposit the gap amount of interest due against the account available balance.
And it will start to be repaid if both A1 and B tranche were paid off

Fixed amount with interest accured.

Pool Collection
----------------------------

Pool Proceeds Split
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The deal docs may split income from pools by pct% to another account

   :language: python
   :emphasize-lines: 39-40

Aggregation on condition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The transaction may require different aggregation rule base on a certain *Pre* or *Deal Status*.
i.e if a deal failed in certain *test* ,then interest portion may aggregate into principal account.

We may just model dummy accounts which accepts Principal and Interest .
But in the Pool Collection waterfall, we can move the funds around base on "if" action in the waterfall, which can be test certain test pass or fail or test current deal status.

Triggers
--------------

Multiple Waterfalls with triggers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There can be multiple waterfalls which corresponding to `status`.
a acceleration/turbo event could be triggered and changing the payment sequence

* amortizing
* revolving
* accelerated
* defaulted 
* clean up

Formula based trigger 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* formula based on delinquency  
* query trigger status via `inspect`

Mannual fire a trigger 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* override trigger message shown in warning logs

Waterfall
--------------

Limit Principal Payment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Using a formula to limit the principal repayment of a bond 
* Using `Inspect` to view the formula value

Define Conditional Action
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

User can specify a conditional clause in the waterfall.

Only the conditions were met, actions following will be executed.

Book Ledger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* User can book a formula based value to ledger 
* query the ledger balance via formula ``("ledgerBalance","<ledgerName>")`` 
  * it can be reference in all places in waterfall/trigger/accounts which are applicable to :ref:`<Formla>`

Yield Supplement Overcollateralization 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning:: this is NOT a complete example!!

the core concept of ``Yield Supplement Overcollateralization`` is 

* price the Schduled cashflow of the pool remaining with two rates ( rate being used, and  a rate of higher of required rate or rate being used )
* subtract the two value, that's amount can be used to paid off to ensure a senior tranche is safe comparing to balance of pool
* usually , there is a constant OC% needed to inflat the OC over adjusted pool balance.

Use Rate Hedge
--------------------

Interest Rate Cap Hedge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* build interest rate cap 
* view interest rate cap flow

Interest Rate Swap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Setup a swap instrument ,merge it into a deal map
* using shortcut `mkDeal` to create a generic deal object 
* Swap can reference a notion with a `formula`
